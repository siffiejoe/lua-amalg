##                           Introduction                           ##

Deploying a Lua application that is split among multiple modules is a
challenge. A tool that can package a Lua script and its modules into
a single file is a valuable help. This is such a tool.

Features:

*   Pure Lua (compatible with Lua 5.1 and up), no other external
    dependencies (plugins may have external dependencies).
*   Even works for modules using the deprecated `module` function.
*   You don't have to take care of the order in which the modules are
    `require`'d.
*   Can embed compiled C modules.
*   Can collect `require`'d Lua (and C) modules automatically.
*   Can compress/decompress or precompile using plugin modules.

What it doesn't do:

*   It doesn't do static analysis of Lua code to collect `require`'d
    modules. That won't work reliably anyway. You can write your own
    program for that (using the output of `luac -p -l`), or use
    [squish][1], or [soar][2] instead.
*   It doesn't handle the dependencies of C modules, so it is best
    used on C modules without dependencies (e.g. LuaSocket, LFS,
    etc.) or with statically linked C modules.

There are alternatives to this program: See [squish][1], [soar][2],
[luac.lua][3], [luacc][4], [many2one][5], and [bundle.lua][6] (and
probably some more).

##                          Getting Started                         ##

You can bundle a collection of modules in a single file by calling the
`amalg.lua` script and passing the module names on the command-line.

    ./amalg.lua module1 module2

The modules are collected using `package.path`, so they have to be
available there. You can use the usual environment variables (e.g.
`LUA_PATH`) to adjust the contents of `package.path`. The resulting
merged Lua code will be written to the standard output stream. You
have to run the code to make the embedded Lua modules available for
`require`.

You can specify an output file to use instead of the standard output
stream.

    LUA_PATH="../src/?.lua;;" ./amalg.lua -o out.lua module1 module2

You can also embed the main script of your application in the merged
Lua code as well. Of course the embedded Lua modules can be
`require`'d in the main script. The main script is specified as a
filename or path, not a module name (it isn't a module after all). (It
*could* be a module, but in that case the amalgamation file has to be
`require`'d before the other embedded modules become available!)

    lua amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua module1 module2

If you want the original filenames and line numbers to appear in
error messages, you have to activate debug mode. This will require
slightly more memory, however.

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -d -s main.lua module1 module2

To collect all Lua (and C) modules used by a program, you can load the
`amalg.lua` script as a module, and it will intercept calls to
`require` and save the necessary Lua module names in a file
`amalg.cache` in the current directory.

    lua -lamalg main.lua

Multiple runs will add to this module cache. But don't access it from
multiple concurrent processes!

You can use the cache (in addition to all module names given on the
command-line) using the `-c` flag.

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua -c

To use a custom file as cache specify `-C <file>`:

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua -C myamalg.cache

However, this will only embed the Lua modules. To also embed C modules
(both from the cache and from the command-line), you have to specify
the `-x` flag:

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua -c -x

This will make the amalgamated script platform and Lua version
dependent, obviously! And it will not embed any external shared
libraries that those modules might depend on.

In some cases you may want to ignore automatically listed modules in
the cache without editing the cache file. Use the `-i` option for that
and specify a Lua pattern:

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua -c -i "^luarocks%."

The `-i` option can be used multiple times to specify multiple
patterns.

Usually, the amalgamated modules take precedence over locally
installed (possibly newer) versions of the same modules. If you want
to use local modules when available and only fall back to the
amalgamated code otherwise, you can specify the `-f` flag.

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua -c -f

This installs another searcher/loader function at the end of the
`package.searchers` (or `package.loaders` on Lua 5.1) and adds a new
table `package.postload` that serves the same purpose as the standard
`package.preload` table.

To fix a compatibility issue with Lua 5.1's vararg handling,
`amalg.lua` by default adds a local alias to the global `arg` table to
every loaded module. If for some reason you don't want that, use the
`-a` flag (but be aware that in Lua 5.1 with `LUA_COMPAT_VARARG`
defined (the default) your modules can only access the global `arg`
table as `_G.arg`).

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -a -s main.lua -c

There is also some compression/decompression support handled via
plugins to `amalg`. To select a compression plugin by name use the
`-z` option. The necessary decompression code typically is embedded in
the result and executed automatically at runtime (may depend on the
plugin).

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua -c -z brieflz

Some plugins generate valid Lua code (text or binary) and thus don't
need a decompression step. For those modules the `-t` option should be
used instead to avoid embedding no-op decompression code in the final
amalgamation file. Multiple compression/transformation steps are
possible, and they are executed in the given order.

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.lua -c -t luasrcdiet -t luac -z brieflz

Note that compression is usually most effective when applied to the
complete amalgamation script instead of just individual modules:

    ./amalg.lua -s main.lua -c | ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s- -t luasrcdiet -z brieflz

Transformation plugins can also be used for transpiling some Lua
dialect to plain Lua code during amalgamation. But plugins cannot
modify the shebang line of the resulting script, so you should set one
yourself if your main script contains one unsuitable for plain Lua
code:

    ./amalg.lua -o out.lua -s main.moon -S "/usr/bin/env lua" -c -t moonscript

If you want to bundle some other read-only files with your amalgamated
script, you can do so with virtual IO and the `-v` switch:

    ./amalg.lua -s main.lua -c -v template.txt

This will embed `template.txt` in the amalgamated script and
monkey-patch the file IO functions if (and only if) the resource is
opened *read-only*. This command-line switch may be used multiple times
for multiple virtual resources. The file path has to match exactly or
else normal file IO is used.

    ./amalg.lua -h

will list all available options (most options are also available as
long options).

That's it. For further info consult the source (there's a nice
[annotated HTML file][7] rendered with [Docco][8] on the GitHub
pages). Have fun!

##                              Plugins                             ##

`amalg.lua` uses two kinds of plugins: transformation plugins and
compression plugins. Transformation plugins are Lua modules that are
called only during amalgamation. Compression plugins consist of two
separate Lua modules that are called during amalgamation and at
runtime to undo the modifications made during amalgamation,
respectively. Since transformation plugins don't have a reverse
transformation step, they are expected to produce valid Lua code (or
Lua binary code). They are used only on pure Lua files (modules or
main script). Compression plugins on the other hand are used on both
Lua files and compiled C modules.

A transformation plugin (used with the command-line option `-t
<name>`) is implemented as a Lua module `amalg.<name>.transform`. The
module exports a function that takes a string (the input source), a
boolean (whether the input source is in Lua source code format), and
the original file path as arguments. It must return a string (the
transformed input) and a boolean indicating whether the result is Lua
source code. It is good practice to handle the case where the input is
not in Lua source code format (but Lua binary code) by skipping the
transformation in this case.

A compression plugin (used with the command-line option `-z <name>`)
is implemented as two separate Lua modules `amalg.<name>.deflate` and
`amalg.<name>.inflate`. The deflate part of the plugin works exactly
like a transformation plugin module. It is called during amalgamation
and may freely use external dependencies. The inflate module should be
implemented as a self-contained pure Lua module as it is embedded into
the amalgamation for the decompression step during runtime. This
module exports a function taking the compressed input as a string and
returning the decompressed output as string as well.

There are currently a few predefined plugins available:

###                           luac Plugin                          ###

The `luac` plugin is a transformation plugin that compiles Lua source
code into stripped Lua binary code. It doesn't have any external
dependencies and passes through binary input (i.e. already compiled
Lua code) unmodified. Note that binary Lua code may be larger than Lua
source code, especially when encoded in Lua's decimal escape notation.
Binary Lua code is also platform dependent. It may or may not load
faster than regular Lua source code. It might make sense to
additionally precompile the entire amalgamated result using `luac`
because you otherwise still depend on Lua source code lexer and
parser, and compressed/binary code in the amalgamated script is bigger
than it needs to be because of the Lua decimal escape notation.

###                        luasrcdiet Plugin                       ###

The `luasrcdiet` plugin is a transformation plugin that minifies Lua
source code by replacing names of local variables, stripping white
space, removing comments, etc. It passes through binary input (i.e.
already compiled Lua code) unmodified. You need to install the
[luasrcdiet][9] module for the amalgamation step. The amalgamated
script doesn't have any extra dependencies. This transformation is a
good choice for reducing the size of the resulting amalgamated Lua
script.

###                      dumbluaparser Plugin                      ###

The `dumbluaparser` transformation plugin is a more recent alternative
to the `luasrcdiet` plugin, and also minifies Lua source code. It may
work better with Lua 5.4-specific source code. As the name implies,
the [DumbLuaParser][16] module has to be available during amalgamation.

###                         brieflz Plugin                         ###

The `brieflz` plugin is a compression plugin that compresses its input
during amalgamation and decompresses it on the fly during runtime. The
compression step relies on the [brieflz][10] module which must be
available during amalgamation. The decompression step is performed by
a pure Lua port of the `blz_depack_safe` function from the
[original C code][11] by Jørgen Ibsen (@jibsen). The decompression
code is embedded into the resulting amalgamation script, so no extra
dependency is needed at runtime, but it adds about 2kB (1kB when
minified with `luasrcdiet`) size overhead. Note that binary data in
the amalgamation is stored in standard Lua decimal escape notation, so
it may be larger than usual. However, brieflz compression still
reduces the size of the resulting amalgamation script in many cases,
and you could precompile the result using the `luac` program (Lua
bytecode doesn't need decimal escape notation).

###                        moonscript Plugin                       ###

The `moonscript` plugin extends `package.path` when it is first loaded
to search for `.moon` files in the same directories as for `.lua`
files. `.moon` files take precedence. Then the plugin translates all
non-binary modules and scripts from moonscript code to Lua code during
amalgamation if the filename of the module or script ends in `.moon`.
The Lua modules of the [moonscript compiler][12] are used for this
translation, so it needs to be installed for the amalgamation step.
Transformation plugins don't have a way to change the shebang lines of
the amalgamated script, so you'll have to do that by hand if necessary
using the `-S`/`--shebang` option.
This plugin is well-behaved in the sense that it checks the file
extension, so you can mix moonscript code, plain Lua code, and code
for other well-behaved transpiler plugins in one amalgamation.

###                           teal Plugin                          ###

The `teal` plugin works in a similar way as the `moonscript` plugin,
but it searches for and processes `.tl` files. The [`tl`][13] module
is used for the source code transformation, so it must be available
during amalgamation.

  [13]: https://luarocks.org/modules/hisham/tl

###                          fennel Plugin                         ###

The `fennel` plugin works in a similar way as the `moonscript` and
`tl` plugin, but it searches for and processes `.fnl` files. The
[`fennel`][14] module is used for the source code transformation, so
it must be available during amalgamation.

##                          Troubleshooting                         ##

> `amalg.lua` does not find modules in the cache file generated via
> `lua -lamalg`

`lua -lamalg` records the module names exactly as they are used
(`require`d) by the application. Therefore, you should always tweak
`package.path` instead of "fixing" the cache file if a module can't be
found during amalgamation. This can happen if the application modifies
its own `package.path` at runtime or changes its working directory.

> My environment does not support `require` or the `package` module!

That's unfortunate. This tool relies on a working `require` function
and a minimal `package` module. See [this Stack Overflow post][15] for
how you can provide minimal stubs for the World of Warcraft
environment. If you can't provide a shared `require` (and `package`)
implementation in your environment, you can use the `-p <file>` switch
to embed one very early in the amalgamation. Obviously this may cause
problems if multiple scripts use this technique, so a common, shared
approach is preferred.
